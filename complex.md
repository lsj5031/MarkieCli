# Markie Stress Test 🚀

This paragraph is intentionally long to test wrapping behavior across a wider line length while mixing **bold text**, *emphasis*, and `inline code` with symbols like `<tag>`, `&`, and quotes "double" / 'single'.

## Mixed Content

- Level 1 bullet A
- Level 1 bullet B with a very long sentence that should wrap cleanly onto the next visual line without colliding with neighboring elements.
  - Level 2 bullet B.1
  - Level 2 bullet B.2 with `code_span_inside_list`
- Level 1 bullet C

1. Ordered one
2. Ordered two
3. Ordered three with extra text to force wrapping behavior and validate spacing.

> Blockquote line one.
> Blockquote line two with **strong** and *emphasis* text.

### Code Block

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from code block");
}
```

Final paragraph to check bottom spacing.
